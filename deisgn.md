- **Card-based layout system** with rounded corners and subtle shadows
- **Responsive grid arrangements**
- **Hardware-accelerated animations** (pulse, slideIn, fadeIn, bounce effects)

### Color Palette
- **Primary Gradient**: #667eea â†’ #764ba2
- **Success States**: #4caf50 variants
- **Error States**: #f44336 variants  
- **Warning States**: #ffc107 variants
- **Info States**: #2196f3 variants
- **Text Colors**: #2d3748 (primary), #718096 (secondary), #a0aec0 (tertiary)

### Current Layout Structure
1. **Header Section** - App branding with icon and title
2. **Status Cards Grid** - System tray and accessibility permission status
3. **Global Shortcut Card** - Keyboard shortcut status and instructions
4. **Manual Cleanup Section** - Dual-panel text editor (original vs cleaned)
5. **Live Clipboard Monitor** - Real-time clipboard content display
6. **Footer** - Pro tips and app version information

3. **Icon set** including app icon and UI symbols
4. **Color system documentation** with usage guidelines
5. **Typography specifications** and hierarchy

### Component Library
1. **Button variations** (primary, secondary, disabled states)
2. **Card components** with different content types
3. **Input fields** and text areas
4. **Status indicators** and notification styles
5. **Loading states** and progress indicators

### Responsive Design
1. **Desktop layouts** (800px+ width)
2. **Compact layouts** (600-800px width)
3. **Mobile layouts** (320-600px width)
4. **Accessibility guidelines** and WCAG compliance

## Current Challenges to Address

### Usability Issues
- **Information density** - Too much content in current layout
- **Visual hierarchy** - Need better content prioritization
- **User onboarding** - First-time user experience
- **Error handling** - Better feedback for failed operations

### Design Opportunities
