# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves the complete removal of all authentication-related code and unused files from the Clipify desktop application. The goal is to simplify the application by removing the OAuth authentication system, deep link handling, token management, and all associated components while maintaining the core text processing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove all authentication-related code so that the application runs without any login requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL NOT require any authentication or login process
2. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL NOT display any authentication UI components (landing page, login forms, fallback auth)
3. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL NOT attempt to initialize any OAuth services or deep link handlers
4. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL NOT show any loading screens related to authentication

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove all unused authentication files so that the codebase is clean and maintainable

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN all authentication context files SHALL be removed
2. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN all OAuth service files SHALL be removed
3. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN all deep link service files SHALL be removed
4. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN all token management files SHALL be removed
5. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN all authentication component files SHALL be removed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove authentication dependencies from the main application so that it starts directly with the core functionality

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL load the main App component directly without authentication wrappers
2. WHEN the application initializes THEN it SHALL NOT import or reference any authentication contexts
3. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL NOT attempt to validate tokens or check authentication status
4. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL NOT initialize service integration manager or startup validators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to clean up all authentication-related imports and references so that the code compiles without errors

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the application THEN there SHALL be no import errors for removed authentication files
2. WHEN running the application THEN there SHALL be no runtime errors related to missing authentication services
3. WHEN reviewing components THEN all references to useAuth, AuthContext, and authentication hooks SHALL be removed
4. WHEN reviewing services THEN all references to tokenStorage, oauthService, and deepLinkService SHALL be removed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove authentication-related UI components so that the interface is simplified

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the header THEN there SHALL be no logout button or authentication status display
2. WHEN using the application THEN there SHALL be no JWT token input fields or authentication configuration
3. WHEN running the application THEN there SHALL be no authentication debug components or fallback auth forms
4. WHEN viewing the interface THEN there SHALL be no OAuth progress indicators or authentication notifications

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused files and dependencies so that the project is optimized

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the file structure THEN all authentication markdown files SHALL be removed
2. WHEN reviewing dependencies THEN unused authentication-related packages SHALL be identified for removal
3. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN all authentication test files SHALL be removed
4. WHEN reviewing services THEN all authentication-related service files SHALL be removed
